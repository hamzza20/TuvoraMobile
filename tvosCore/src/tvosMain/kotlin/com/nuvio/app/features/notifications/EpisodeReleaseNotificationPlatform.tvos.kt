// tvOS user notifications can only badge the app icon; they cannot show an alert or play a sound, so a
// "new episode is out" banner has no Apple TV equivalent. Named gap: authorization is reported as
// unavailable, which makes the shared repository skip scheduling, and the settings toggle stays off.
